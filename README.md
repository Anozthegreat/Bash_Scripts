# My Bash Scripts
This is the repository containing all my bash scripts that I have made.
All scripts have appropriate echo statements for clear readability in CLI.

Below are some brief description of the scripts that are present here:

1. move_torrentsfiles.sh : move .torrent files from source directory to destination directory. You have to manually put the source and destination directory once.
2. find_file.sh : this is for searching a file in a specified directory. The file name you are searching for does not have to be complete. And in that case, displays all the files                    which are similar to the query you are searching for. 
                  (USAGE EXAMPLE : sh find_file.sh /run/media/John/Home/Downloads myfile)
